       <p class="text-justify">
          The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the Red Junglefowl. As one of the most common and widespread domestic animals with a population of more than 24 billion in 2003,[1] there are more chickens in the world than any other species of bird. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs.</br></br>
          The traditional poultry farming view of the domestication of the chicken is stated in Encyclopædia Britannica (2007): "Humans first domesticated chickens of Indian origin for the purpose of cockfighting in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Very little formal attention was given to egg or meat production... "[2] Recent genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in Southeast, East, and South Asia, but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent. From India the domesticated fowl made its way to the Persianized kingdom of Lydia in western Asia Minor, and domestic fowl were imported to Greece by the fifth century BC.[3] Fowl had been known in Egypt since the 18th Dynasty, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Tutmose III.[4][5]</br></br>
          In the UK and Ireland adult male chickens over the age of 12 months are primarily known as cocks, whereas in America, Australia and Canada they are more commonly called roosters. Males less than 1 year old are cockerels.[6] Castrated roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world).[citation needed] Females over a year old are known as hens and younger females as pullets[7] although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs at 16 to 20 weeks of age. In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook /ˈtʃʊk/ to describe all ages and both sexes. The young are called chicks and the meat is called chicken.</br></br>
          In some breeds the adult rooster can be distinguished from the hen by his larger comb
          Chicken" originally referred to chicks, not the species itself. The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens", sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).
          In the Deep South of the United States chickens are also referred to by the slang term yardbird.

       <h2 class="menu-title text-center beef" id="Beef">BEEF</h2>
       <p class="text-justify">
        The production of beef produces requires a lot of energy and leaves a huge carbon footprint on planet earth. The process of producing beef goes far beyond raising cattle. It includes heavy water use, immense amounts of land to grow grain and/or corn, and requires an almost endless amount transportation. We have to consider not only the amount of land the cattle physically occupy, but also the amount of land used to grow the huge amount of food they require. To put it into perspective, the production of beef uses “30% of the earth’s land mass” (Peta 2013). In addition, it takes 31.5kWh of energy to produce 1lb of beef, approximately 58lbs of CO2 emissions (Federal Register 2010). Speaking of energy, the amount of grain fed to cattle is staggeringly high. Including beef cattle and dairy cattle if all that feed “were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million" (Pimentel, David 2014). And yet another aspect of this, perhaps an externality effect on the environment is deforestation, land dehydration, and contamination of water sources from runoff.</br></br>
        Another aspect we looked at was water consumption. The amount of water required to raise cattle for beef is shockingly high. And a lot of this is not only due to the direct consumption of water by the cattle, but the indirect consumption through the food they eat. The crops themselves require a lot of water as well. Combine the water for agriculture for the beef cattle and the direct consumption of water and we find that “nearly half of the water used in the United States” is strictly used for the beef cattle industry.</br></br>
        Beef is raised and/or eaten in most countries of the world. It’s price and frequency of consumption varies depending on availability. In the US it is readily available and relatively cheap; this is why we eat quite a bit. In other parts of the world like Japan it is difficult to raise due to limited space so it eaten less often and is very expensive.</br></br>
        During butchering each animal is divided into large “chunks” called primals. In butcher shops and some high-end restaurants you will find personnel who can butcher a whole side of beef. But in today’s supermarkets you will find people called meat cutters who do not cut beef from the side. They only break down beef from these large primal cuts into fabricated cuts that are sold at the retail level. Each primal yields specific market cuts.</br></br>
        As animals move about in the field they exercise their muscles, on a beef the front shoulder area gets a lot of muscle activity. The rear of the animal also gets a lot of movement, but since they walk around forward the front gets more. The most muscle development and consequently the toughest meats, happens in the front legs of the beef. The amount of fat accumulation (which is certainly related to how much activity an animal has had and the type of feed they have been given) determines the grade the animal achieves. The grade determines the price per pound of the animal. The picture shows a piece of Kobe beef with tremendous marbling.Beef is raised and/or eaten in most countries of the world.

       <h2 class="menu-title text-center" id="Sushi">SUSHI</h2>
       <p class="text-justify">
     It is generally accepted that sushi is symbol of Japanese eating style that is known worldwide. It is the popular dishes not only in Japan but also outside of Japan as, Thailand. The history of sushi is interesting. Even if Sushi is one of the representative foods of Japan today, but its origin is found in China around the 4th century. Originally, sushi referred to fermenting fish with salt and rice which was influenced from Thai and Loa farmers. In contrast, sushi in modern times refers to the rice, not the fish. Japanese and Thai have rather same in eating culture because fish and rice is the main ingredients in their dishes. In Thailand, sushi is available in many place such as Japanese restaurant, supermarket or even in fair market because of popularity in all ages. However, some sushi Thai lovers do not know about the types of sushi, the health effect of sushi and eating tip. Sushi has long revolution from the past. In those days, the first type of sushi is called Nare-sushi that the rice was discarded and only the fish meat is eaten. Its fermented time is about 1 to 3 years. After that, during the 15th century, Nama-Nari-sushi was developed.</br></br>
     Sushi is not only delicious, but it’s also very good for consumers. First, Sushi is low in calories. The most of sea fish have less than 100 calories. Moreover, Oily fish, such as mackerel and sardine are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Second, rice vinegar has amazing antibacterial properties and also lowering the risk of high blood pressure.</br></br>
